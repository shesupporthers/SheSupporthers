She Support(h)ers : A django based web application for womem's empowerment

This application is to provide a one stop platform to overcome the innumerable challenges faced by women, a community for women to discuss their day to day activities, providing enormous amount of data, a discussion panel to share their ideas and form a network of women, by women and for the women of today and forever.

The project is implemented using the Django framework. For the front end we have used HTML, CSS and Javascript using the Bootstrap framework.
